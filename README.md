High School capstone project, a simple calendar web application for keeping track of homework assignments.

While not friendly to small screens, and not altogether very useful, it was a good practice project.

The repo is designed to be pulled directly into production from vercel.com. My current deployment can be found at https://homework-calendar.vercel.app.

This web application utilizes ElephantSQL for data storage, which unfortunately is projected to be shut down January 27, 2025.

Update! (3/29/2025) This web application has been linked to a new database and is now active!

---
Update! (8/9/2025) The new database (hosted by Tembo) was shut down this summer. This app is once again inactive ...for now.
